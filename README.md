# Movie-Recommendation

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation techniques. The system leverages the MovieLens dataset from Kaggle, specifically utilizing the credits.csv and movies.csv files for movie metadata and user ratings.

# Overview
The movie recommendation system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their past preferences and movie metadata. It incorporates both collaborative filtering, which recommends movies based on user similarities, and content-based filtering, which suggests movies similar to those the user has liked before. Hybrid techniques combine these approaches to improve recommendation accuracy and coverage.

# Features
1. Collaborative Filtering: User-Based and Item-Based approaches for recommendation.

2. Content-Based Filtering: Leveraging movie metadata such as genre, director, and cast.

3. Hybrid Techniques: Combining collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.

4. Real-Time Recommendations: Interactive interface powered by Streamlit framework for seamless user interaction.
